== Description ==

**OTW Grid Manager**

Build custom page layouts. Create as many rows and columns as you need.

**Demo site and Online documentation**

See [Demo site](http://otwthemes.com/demos/1ts/?item=Content%20Manager%20Light&utm_source=wp.org&utm_medium=page&utm_content=demo&utm_campaign=cml) and [Online documentation](http://otwthemes.com/online-documentation-content-manager-light-wordpress-plugin/?utm_source=wp.org&utm_medium=page&utm_content=docs&utm_campaign=cml) for more info on this plugin.

**Shortcodes/Content**

Insert any of the ready to use shortcodes to fill in content in your columns. All settings are done in a nice and easy interface. Here is the list of shortcodes:

* Button
* Info boxes
* Dropcaps
* Quotes
* Unordered Lists
* Ordered Lists
* Tabs
* Toggles
* Dividers (Horizontal rules)
* HTML editor

**Custom styling and skins**

Most of the styles for the shortcodes will be inherited from your theme. Some will come with the plugin. If you want to style a shortcode any way different you can either use the ready css classes or place your own for each shortcode individually (in shortcodes' settings screen). You can also create a custom skin in a separate file and make the plugin load it form the plugin options page.

**Full version**

A full version of the plugin with tons of more options and shortcodes, front-end editor, custom shortcodes builder and more is on its way. Stay tuned!
